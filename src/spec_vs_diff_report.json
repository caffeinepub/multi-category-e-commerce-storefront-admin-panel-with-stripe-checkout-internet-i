However, the diff evidence is insufficient to confirm that no other backend APIs or seeded/default data still reference the removed categories, and it does not fully demonstrate behavior for direct navigation to removed category IDs beyond a generic name fallback.",

      "reason": "CategoryListingPage uses a generic fallback name for unknown IDs and shows an empty-state when `products.length === 0`, but the diff does not show that `useGetProductsByCategory` (backend/query layer) returns an appropriate empty result for removed/unknown IDs, nor does it explicitly demonstrate handling for the specific removed IDs beyond the label fallback.",
